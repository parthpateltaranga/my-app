      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">Commissions & Conflict Disclosure</h1>
      <p className="mt-4">As licensed insurance brokers, we are compensated in a number of ways. Our goal is to provide you with the best insurance products and services available. This page outlines how we are paid and any potential conflicts of interest.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Our Compensation</h2>
      <p className="mt-4">For the services we provide, we receive a commission from the insurance companies we represent. This commission is included in the premium you pay. The commission is a percentage of the premium and varies depending on the type of insurance and the insurer.</p>
      <p className="mt-4">The following is a range of commissions we receive from our partner insurance companies:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-4">
        <li>Automobile Insurance: 5% to 12.5% of premium</li>
        <li>Property (Home) Insurance: 10% to 20% of premium</li>
        <li>Commercial Insurance: 10% to 20% of premium</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mt-4">In addition to commission, we may also be eligible for contingent profit commissions or other incentive-based compensation from some of our insurance partners. This compensation is not guaranteed and is based on a number of factors, including profitability, volume, and retention. This additional compensation is not a direct charge to you.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Potential Conflicts of Interest</h2>
      <p className="mt-4">Our goal is to always act in your best interest. We represent a number of insurance companies to ensure you have a choice of products and services. We will disclose any potential conflict of interest to you at the time of quotation and sale.</p>
      <p className="mt-4">If you have any questions about our compensation or any potential conflicts of interest, please do not hesitate to ask us.</p>
